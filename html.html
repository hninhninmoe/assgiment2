      >HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a
      web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within
      a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data
      tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic
      understanding of HTML and its functions.HTML is a markup language that
      defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of
      elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the
      content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The
      enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can
      italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.</p1
