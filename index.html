    <h1>What is JavaScript</h1>
    <p1
      >JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the
      client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive.
      Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web
      pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.
      Common examples of JavaScript that you might use every day include the
      search box on Amazon, a news recap video embedded on The New York Times,
      or refreshing your Twitter feed. Incorporating JavaScript improves the
      user experience of the web page by converting it from a static page into
      an interactive one. To recap, JavaScript adds behavior to web pages.</p1
